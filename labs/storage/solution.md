# Lab Solution

You need to set the access mode and the storage class name in the PVC:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: pvc-azurefile
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
  storageClassName: azurefile
  resources:
    # ...
```

The sample file in [labs/storage/lab/pvc-azurefile.yaml](./lab/pvc-azurefile.yaml) does that. The updated [labs/storage/lab/deployment.yaml](./lab/deployment.yaml)] uses the new PVC.

Update the deployment:

```
kubectl apply -f labs/storage/lab/

kubectl get pods --watch
```

It will take a minute or two for the new Azure Files storage to get provisioned. When the new Pod is running you can delete it:

```
kubectl delte pod <pod-name>
```

And then check the database file in the new Pod:

```
kubectl exec -it deploy/queue-worker -- cat /mnt/database/app.db
```

In the Portal if you open the autogenerated `MC_` Resource Group, you'll see a Storage Account resource with a random name. Open that and select _File shares_ on the left nav. You'll see a share with a random name, starting `pvc-`. Open that and you'll see the `app.db` file the Pods are writing to (you can even edit in the Portal and see the changes in the Pod).
